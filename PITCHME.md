        - Picture [TBD]
    - Coke -> Code? (Maybe)
        - Picture [TBD]
    - StackOverflow -> Code :devil_face:

## What is programming?
    - *Solving problems*
        - Picture [TBD]

    - Problem -> Solution
        - [TBD]

---
## How to solve problems?
    - Problem -> Smaller solvable problems
    - Glue those smaller solvable problems together

## How to solve problems?
    - (Maybe)
        - Tools
            - Different people uses different tools
        - Designer: [TBD]
    - Programmer
        - Programming languages (Assembly, Pascal, C, Java, Ruby, Python,
            Haskel, Clojure, Rust...)

## Programming paradigms
Different programming paradigms provide different kind of glue
    - ...
    - Structure Programming
    - Procedure Programming
    - Object Oriented Programming
    - Functional Programming

## Functional Programming's Glues
    - High-Order function
        - Function as first class citizen
    - Referential Transparent
        - Same input -> Same output
    - Lazy evaluation?
    - Immutability?
